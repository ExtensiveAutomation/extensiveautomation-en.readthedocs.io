Adapters and libraries
========================

The version of the adapters (or libraries) to use by default for a test
can be configured. It is also possible to use multiple versions of adapters (or libraries) in parallel on a test.

It is therefore advisable to define:
  - a default version to use
  - but also a generic version

Separation in default or generic version allows
to evolve your adapters (or libraries) independently
