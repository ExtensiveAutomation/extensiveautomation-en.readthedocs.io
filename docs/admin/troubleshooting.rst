Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

How to change the listening port (tcp / 443) of the server?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~

Edit the `` / etc / httpd / conf.d / extensivetesting.conf`` file and change the listening port of the virtual host 443.
Do not forget to modify the `` /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`` file to add the new listening port.

.. note :: An apache restart is needed.

How to change the connection port of the client?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The destination port can be changed from the client preferences.
Or directly from the `` settings.ini`` file.

View the server version?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    ./xtctl version
    Server version: 18.0.0
    
What to do if the server installation does not work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

The server installation process is logged in an `` install.log`` file in the directory after extracting the package.
It is necessary to look for the error messages present in the file.

What if my connection to the server does not work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

If the connection from the client to the server does not work, an analysis is necessary.

The first SLR to have is to connect to the server in SSH and execute the `` xtctl status`` command to check if the server is running.

1. If the server is running then check:
  - network connectivity in the client and the server
  - a firewall blocking the https flow (443)

2. If the network connectivity is good and the server is working (or not), check the logs.
The file is available in the `` / opt / xtc / current / Var / Logs / output.log`` directory. You must look for messages of type `` ERROR``

How to fix the error "hping3 is not installed"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

This error occurs while running a test when the `` Pinger`` adapter is used.
Indeed requires to have the hping3 system library installed on the server.

You have to retrieve the sources from https://github.com/antirez/hping and compile them:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  cd hping-master
  yum install libpcap-devel-1.5.3-9.el7.x86_64
  ln -s /usr/include/pcap/bpf.h /usr/include/net/bpf.h
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  
How to install the server in a specific directory?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~

By default, the server installs in the directory `` / opt / xtc / ``, it is possible to change this directory
at installation time by changing the `` INSTALL`` key in the `` default.cfg`` file

.. code-block:: bash
  
  INSTALL=/opt/xtc/

Server installation remains stuck on adding external libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting the server installation, check that the yum service is not already running.
If so, the installation script will remain blocked until `` yum`` is available. This issue
Usually happens when the server is installed in graphical mode.

In the logs, we can observe the following error:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  Existing lock /var/run/yum.pid: another copy is running as pid 3293.
  Another app is currently holding the yum lock; waiting for it to exit...
    The other application is: PackageKit
      Memory :  26 M RSS (429 MB VSZ)
      Started: Tue Nov  1 11:09:25 2016 - 00:42 ago
      State  : Sleeping, pid: 3293

To solve this problem, you must stop the program that already uses `` yum``.

Can not navigate in the web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can connect to the web interface but can not navigate the menus.
The cookie generated by the server may be expired, it must be verified that the server is on time.
